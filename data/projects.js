      description: 'Locke Lorde, a premier full-service law firm, challenged our team to “push the limits” of the typical law firm site. To create a unique and modern feel to the site, we completely reimagined their digital presence, threading in thoughtful microinteractions, and adding subtle movement to call-to-action imagery to capture the user’s attention. Introducing new colors, the site leverages gradients to highlight the firm’s forward-focused design. Their new site is flexible, provides their team more autonomy and is future-forward, ready to grow and evolve as the firm does.',
